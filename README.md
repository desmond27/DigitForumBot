# DigitForumBot 
[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/desmond27/DigitForumBot.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/desmond27/DigitForumBot)

----

A Telegram bot that posts the latest posts from the [Digit Forum](https://geek.digit.in/community).

I am fairly new to Kotlin programming while coming from a Java background. I mostly wrote this as a way to practice programming with Kotlin.

## Building
Before building, you need to get your own bot token and bot username using [@BotFather](https://telegram.im/BotFather). More details on creating Telegram bots can be found [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots#3-how-do-i-create-a-bot).

Once you have your own bot token and bot username, enter these details in the [app.properties](https://github.com/desmond27/DigitForumBot/blob/master/src/main/resources/app.properties) file against the fields `NEW_POSTS_BOT_TOKEN` and `NEW_POSTS_BOT_USERNAME`.

Set the frequency of posting as needed against `POSTING_FREQUENCY_SECONDS`, the default value is one hour.

After this, run `mvn clean package` in the project root, and you will get the built executable JAR in the target directory as `DigitForumBot-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`. This can now be run as `java -jar DigitForumBot-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.

## Adding the bot to your chat
Search for your bot via the handle and add it to your chat.

Once added, either post `/start` or `/start@<bot username>` if you have multiple bots. You should receive a message like:

```
Welcome! DigitForumBot has been activated for this chat.
```

After this, you will receive a message with the latest posts based on the frequency you have set above.

## TODO

Some future enhancements that need to be implemented:

* ~~Add support for deactivating in a chat.~~
* Add support for additional updates from the forum such as user updates.
* Generalize the bot to work with any Xenforo based forum.
* Make the executable configurable to accept properties from a properties file outside the JAR or from arguments or from environment variables.
* Decouple the parser from the bot.
